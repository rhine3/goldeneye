# goldeneye/src: Notebooks and data for updating Goldeneye

To update Goldeneye when new Institute for Bird Populations (IBP) or Bird Banding Laboratory (BBL) taxonomies are released, follow the instructions in the `alpha-code-prep.ipynb` notebook. 

You may need to change the download links for the IBP and BBL taxonomies.

As you go through the notebook, carefully inspect the outputs and make updates to the code as needed.
